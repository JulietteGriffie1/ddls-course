Welcome to the Data-Driven Life Sciences Course at KTH! Thank you for agreeing to be a guest lecturer. Your expertise will add immense value to our course. Below are some guidelines to help you prepare your lecture, computer lab, and seminar.

## Overview of the Course

- **Aim**: Introduce students to computer-driven life sciences, covering a variety of application areas.
- **Data Types**: Genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, biomolecular structure, molecular dynamics simulations, imaging etc.
- **Intended Learning Outcomes**: By the end of this course, students should be able to describe the field, apply statistical and machine learning analysis, review scientific literature, and reflect on ethical considerations in data-driven life sciences.

## Preparing Your Lecture

- **Focus**: Provide an overview of your specialized area in the context of data-driven life sciences.
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Describe your field's applications and associated analysis methods.
  - Discuss models of biological phenomena based on data analysis.
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Format**: Slides, Videos, and Q&A session. The lecture will be held over Zoom ([link](https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/69812177998)), please join the zoom call 5 minutes before the lecture starts so we can test the connection.
- **Audience Background**: Master's students in Biomedical Physics and Medical Engineering; Ph.D. students in Molecular Science, enzyme engineering, biomedical sciences, etc.

## Preparing Computer Lab

For some lecture, it will be helpful to provide a Jupyter notebook to help students understand the concepts better. In the computer lab session, the student will work on the Jupyter notebook with tutorials and coding exercises. The notebook will be executed in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). In the end of the computer lab, the finished exercise notebook will be submitted and graded first by the peers and then by the lab teachers.

Here are more details to help you prepare the notebook:

- **Objective**: Enable students to practically explore data using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Lab Outline**:
  - Introduction to your topicâ€™s data set.
  - Statistical and machine learning exercises.
  - Coding tasks directly related to your field.
- **Duration**: Usually held on Wednesdays, approx 2 hours.
- **Platform**: Google Colab.
- **Grading**: Students will submit their finished notebooks to be graded, first by their peer and then by the teacher.
- **Format**: The lab will be held in person, with the lab teachers present to help students.

## Providing a Paper for the Seminar

- **Objective**: Enable collective discussion and critical review of scientific literature.
- **Paper Selection**:
  - Should be a peer-reviewed paper related to your field, ideally your published paper.
  - Should introduce models or applications of biological phenomena based on data.
- **Duration**: Usually held on Fridays, approx 2 hours.
- **Format**: Students will read the paper before the session, discuss and answer the [question sheet](/uploads/JournalClub.pdf) during the seminar.
- **Grading**: Participation and answers to the questions will be graded.
