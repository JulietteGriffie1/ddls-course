Hi all,

Good to see many of you during the computer lab today. I have been reading your submitted chat history in [assignment 1](/course/ddls-2023/module-1/assignment-1/). I am also very happy to see that you are using ChatGPT to help you with your assignments. In the meantime, based on the interaction with some of you in email and during the computer lab. I would like to provide further clarification on the expectation for the course, the assignments and some suggestions on using ChatGPT.

## Learning to learn

As a major aim of this course, I would like to equip you with the right mindset, tools and skills for performing data-driven life science research. In particular, I would like to help you to learn how to learn. This means you should be able to learn new things by yourself, and you should be able to learn more efficiently, using ChatGPT as an assistive tool. With this in mind, I would like you to focus more on learning the data-driven mindset, and the skills to efficiently learn new things, rather than the specific content of the course.

For example, in [assignment 1](/course/ddls-2023/module-1/assignment-1/), the point is not to learn the content of the book, but to learn how to use ChatGPT to help you learn the content of the book. By expose yourself to a huge amount of text under a complex topic, you will have to use ChatGPT efficiently. In a way, if you feel more struggle with the content, it should use ChatGPT more efficiently to accelerate the learning process.

## Improve your prompt

Based on the submitted conversation history, I found that most of you are not using it to its full potential because you didn't provide enough context.

Please keep in mind that you should always provide enough context in your initial prompt to obtain tailed answers -- this is how you can accelerate your learning, for example, when reading the book.

I would suggest that you put more effort on constructing an efficient prompt which you will be using through the course. This means you can paste that content as the first message when you start a new conversation in ChatGPT.

Besides the example I showed you previously in [assignment 1](/course/ddls-2023/module-1/assignment-1/). I would like to show you another way to create your prompt -- using ChatGPT to create a prompt for ChatGPT.

## Using ChatGPT to create a prompt for ChatGPT
Since the prompt is basically a text contains the necessary information to guide ChatGPT to generate the content you want, you can use ChatGPT to help you create a prompt for ChatGPT.

To start, you can create a new conversation in ChatGPT, and use the following prompt:
````
Act as an expert in  prompt engineering for ChatGPT, help me create a prompt to facilitate the learning in a course I am taking as a student, here is more about the course:
-----
The course aims to introduce you to the field of computer-driven life sciences by letting you learn about their different application areas.

This course introduces data sets of different types, such as proteomics, transcriptomics, biomolecular structure, molecular dynamics simulations and different types of imaging, and presents, analyzes and discusses models of biological phenomena and related scientific breakthroughs based on the analysis of such data sets.

## Course goals (Intended Learning Outcomes)
-   describe the field of data-driven life sciences, including an overview of the different application areas, and give examples of applications and their associated analysis methods
-   apply statistical analysis and machine learning analysis to biological data sets and formulate models of biological phenomena
-   present and review scientific literature in the field of computer-driven life sciences
-   reflect on ethical consequences of data-driven life sciences and describe good practice around the computer life cycle (collection, handling, sharing and analysis)
-----

Now based on the course description and learning outcomes, help me create a prompt which I will use  to guide ChatGPT in help me learning with the lecture, computer lab and seminar. 

Ask me for all the necessary information about me (be specific!) and create the prompt if you collected all the information. 

The proposed prompt should look something like this:
```
Hi, I'm a master student ....

Anwser "OK" only , if you get me!
``` 
I will reuse the prompt (paste it in the beginning of the conversation) for all the conversations during the course.


To construct the prompt, now ask me about myself.
````

Then you can start the conversation and ChatGPT will ask you questions about yourself. You can answer the questions and ChatGPT will generate a prompt for you. 

You can review the prompt, provide clarification, improve it manually or ask ChatGPT to improve it based on your specific needs. Then copy and paste the prompt to the beginning of the conversation and ChatGPT will use it to help you with your assignments.

[Here](https://chat.openai.com/share/ceb732ed-2c57-429d-bea2-90af4b682cd6) is an example conversation history.

## Obtain feedback from ChatGPT

Besides the initial prompt, in the conversation with ChatGPT, it is also important to ask the right questions to ChatGPT to get the most out of it. To improve your interaction with ChatGPT, you can ask ChatGPT for feedback on your prompt.

In the end of an existing conversation, you something like the following to ChatGPT:
```
Act as an expert in prompt engineering for ChatGPT, please provide advice to enhance my prompt engineering skills for more effective interactions with ChatGPT, with the goal of optimizing its assistance in my learning journey. Could you please analyze the prompt I previously used as an example and provide concrete suggestions on how to refine it for better outcomes?
```

Then you will see some suggestions from ChatGPT. You can then use the suggestions to improve your prompt.
