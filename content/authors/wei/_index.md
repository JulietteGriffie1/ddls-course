Hey there! I'm Wei Ouyang, an assistant professor over at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

I'm super excited to be leading the course [SK2538/FSK3538: Data-Driven Life Science](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/SK2538) kicking off in 2023!

When I'm not teaching, you can find me leading the [AICell Lab](https://aicell.io). We're all about using AI to crack some of the toughest puzzles in cell and molecular biology. In addition, I've also got a soft spot for making scientific tools accessible and open.
