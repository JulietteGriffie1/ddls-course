For the computer lab, you will be given a Jupyter notebook with basic intro to generative AI models along with some exercises on how to use diffusion models to design a protein.

The code repository we will work on is [RFdiffusion](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion), a notebook will be made available on the day of the lab.

Here are the references:
