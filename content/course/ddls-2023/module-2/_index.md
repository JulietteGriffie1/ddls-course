We will introduce the basics of generative AI and its potential in life science.

We will cover from Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models and Large Language Models. One of the focus is on how generative AI can be used for generating protein sequences.

We will also cover recent trend of using generative large-language models and practical skills on how to use ChatGPT for reading, writing, planning and code generation.

Lecture by Wei Ouyang on 5th Sept.
