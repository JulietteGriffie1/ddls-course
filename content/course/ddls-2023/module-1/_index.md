This first week is an introduction week where we give you access to the background material needed understand all of the other 6 topical modules.

Before this module, we recommend you take a look at the [prerequisites](../prerequisites/).

## Lecture

In the lecture, we will introduce the course and the different modules. We will also introduce the concept of data-driven life sciences and the data life cycle, and basics of machine learning.


## Computer Lab
In particular we will use chapters 2-6 of [this interactive online book](https://dmol.pub/ml/introduction.html). For most of you, this should be a repetition of the data analysis methods and concepts that you have been exposed to in previous classes. If the topics don't feel familiar, you probably need to spend extra time studying those outside of scheduled hours this week as these will come back again and again when we explore biological topics in more details.

This week's lab is meant to catch you up with concepts and coding skills that you will need for the rest of the class.

This online book introduces almost all the necessary concepts in machine learning and data analysis, and our aim is to cover chapter 2-6 this week. The corresponding code can be run in Jupyter notebooks on your own computers.

This lab will not be graded, but you have to answer a quiz to verify that the notions covered this week are familiar enough to successfully get through the other modules.

### Preparation

You can find an introduction on how to use google colab [here](./colab-intro).

### Run the code
Now, go to [this interactive online book](https://dmol.pub/ml/introduction.html) and run the code in the chapters 2-6.

Make sure to use your access to teaching assistants to get this material under control. The machine learning topics covered this week are probably going to be important for your projects (see [Project Plan](../project)) too, i.e. finding ways to expand on published research using a different type of analysis, or model validation, etc.

By the end of the week, you are assigned to pass a quiz to check your familiarity with this week's the material.

In addition, here are other resources that could be useful to clarify useful concepts in data analysis, machine learning and deep learning:
- [Neural Networks](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks)
- [Deep learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539)
- [Bias–variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)

## Seminar

In the [seminar](./seminar), we will have two activities: 

1. We will introduce what will happen in the seminars in the other weeks and in particular walk you through the [question sheet](/uploads/JournalClub.pdf) that we will use each week. You will learn how a scientific paper is typically structured and thus where to find the answer to those questions. Since the other seminars will be graded according to how well you answer these question, make sure to ask any questions you have about the structure of the seminars!
2. In project groups, you will give a short account of your online exploration of the data-driven life science topic online, and talk about 2 papers and an open databank where biological information is gathered and openly shared. See more guidelines about this assignment under the [seminar](./seminar) page.
