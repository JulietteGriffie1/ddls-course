### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to deepen your understanding of Chapters 2-6 from [this interactive online textbook on machine learning](https://dmol.pub/ml/introduction.html). For many of you, the methods and concepts discussed in these chapters will be a review of what you've learned in prior courses. If you find any topics unfamiliar, we strongly recommend allocating additional time for study this week, as these concepts will frequently reappear when we delve into biological topics in greater depth.

### Objectives
- Understand core data analysis methods and principles presented in Chapters 2-6.
- Utilize ChatGPT as an assistive tool for grasping complex topics and clarifying any questions you may have.
