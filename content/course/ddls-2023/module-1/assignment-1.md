In [assignment 1](./assignment-1), you were asked to use ChatGPT to facilitate your learning of the chapters 2-6 ofÂ [this interactive online book](https://dmol.pub/ml/introduction.html). For most of you, this should be a repetition of the data analysis methods and concepts that you have been exposed to in previous classes. If the topics don't feel familiar, you probably need to spend extra time studying those outside of scheduled hours this week as these will come back again and again when we explore biological topics in more details.

When reading the book, try to use ChatGPT to help your understanding. Please explore different prompts to see how the answers change.

Here is the cheatsheet for ChatGPT: [ChatGPT cheatsheet](/uploads/ChatGPT-Cheat-Sheet.pdf).

While reading the online book (chapter 2-6) with the help of ChatGPT, your chat history should reflect what you did during the process.

Once you are done, please submit the chat history link(s) [here](https://forms.gle/arapqVSDJFyKMqZb6):
. The chat history links can be created by following the instructions [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7943611-create-a-shared-link). In case you started multiple chat sessions, please submit all of them (one link per line).

**NOTE: The submission of this assignment will be graded and used as the grade for the computer lab.**
