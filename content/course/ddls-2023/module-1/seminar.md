This week's seminar is divided into two parts:

1.  The first half will introduce how the rest of the seminars will look. In particular, we will look together at the [question sheet](/uploads/JournalClub.pdf) that we will use every week, and learn where to find answers to these questions in a typical research article (we will use [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) to introduce this topic). Indeed, the aim of these seminars is to teach you how to read a scientific article about a data-driven life science topic and learning to find answers to these questions will teach you how to do this systematically. Each week, you will all be assigned a paper to read, and you should be ready to discuss the answers to all of these questions during the seminar. Everyone will be selected at random to answer one or more questions from the question sheet, and/or describe selected figures. The quality of your answers and of your general participation will determine your grade for each seminar.
2.  The [second assignment](../assignment-2) this week is to work in your project group to map out data-driven life science research. The idea is that each group gives a very short presentation of two peer-reviewed papers that fall under the umbrella of data-driven life sciences and a database that openly shares data that can be used in future research. The hope is that between 5-6 project groups, we get a good overview of research topics and start understanding what is the policy that researchers take around data-driven life sciences. This will also give us an opportunity to discuss pros and cons and ethical aspects of data sharing. Each presentation should not exceed 4 minutes.Â 

Note that this week's seminar will also serve as foundation for your projects! Indeed, a large part of the project is to choose a paper of interest, read and dissect it. The rest of the project consists in reanalyzing the data in a different manner, for which this week's lab is probably very important.
