Course Code: [`SK2538` (master's)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/SK2538) / [`FSK3538` (PhD)](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/FSK3538)

Welcome to data driven life sciences!
-------------------------------------

We are glad to welcome you.

The course aims to introduce you to the field of computer-driven life sciences by letting you learn about their different application areas.

This course introduces data sets of different types, such as proteomics, transcriptomics, biomolecular structure, molecular dynamics simulations and different types of imaging, and presents, analyzes and discusses models of biological phenomena and related scientific breakthroughs based on the analysis of such data sets.

Course goals (Intended Learning Outcomes)

We hope that you, by the end of this course, will be able to:

-   describe the field of data-driven life sciences, including an overview of the different application areas, and give examples of applications and their associated analysis methods
-   apply statistical analysis and machine learning analysis to biological data sets and formulate models of biological phenomena
-   present and review scientific literature in the field of computer-driven life sciences
-   reflect on ethical consequences of data-driven life sciences and describe good practice around the computer life cycle (collection, handling, sharing and analysis)

Course design
-------------

The course is divided into 6 modules, each module running for a week. Each week contains 3 main activities: a lecture on Tuesday, giving background information about the topic(s) of the week; a computer lab, usually on Wednesday, where you will practically explore data exploration using Python in Jupyter notebooks; and a seminar on Friday where you will collectively explain and discuss an assigned research paper.

Both the computer lab and the seminars are mandatory and graded activities!

- For the labs, you be given a Jupyter notebook with tutorials and coding exercises. You will be running and practicing coding by running the Jupyter notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). During the lab session, you can discuss your answers with the lab teachers. You will submit your final notebook with answers to the questions to be graded.

- For the seminar, you will have a list of questions (the same every week) which we will answer during the seminar. Your participation and answer to these questions will be graded during the seminar.

In addition, there is a project to be conducted in pairs (Ms students) or alone (PhD students).

Here are the published modules for the course:

(The list of modules will be updated as the course progresses.)

Each module will contain quiz or assignment, please pay attention to the deadline.

### Grades

The final grade on the course is determined as follows:

-   The computer labs are graded P/F. To pass, you need to attend all the labs and answer the questions to a satisfactory degree.
-   Participation in the seminars is graded as P/F. To pass, you need to read the assigned papers, attend all the seminars and participate in discussions.
-   The project is graded P/F. To pass, you need to carry out the project, and get a passing grade on the project report.
-   The oral exam (project presentation) at the end of course will be graded A-F scale.

-   For master students, the grade on the oral exam determines the final grade on the course provided the other three activities have received a passing grade.
-   For PhD students, the oral exam is not mandatory, but you are welcome to join the oral exam if you want to practice your presentation skills.
